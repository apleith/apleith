### 🧠 About Me

I research **social and interactive media**, exploring how we communicate and build communities in **virtual reality**, **remote work environments**, and **online gaming cultures**. My work uses **computational and mixed-methods** to understand and help shape more inclusive, equitable, and engaging digital spaces.

My current research areas include:

  * 🕶️ **Virtual Worlds & The Future of Work:** Investigating communication, equity, and well-being in virtual classrooms and workplaces.
  * 🧠 **VR for Neurodiversity:** Exploring how platforms like VRChat can address communication barriers for individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder.
  * 🤖 **AI & Human Interaction:** Developing and studying AI agents for modeling and feedback in technical learning environments.
  * 📺 **Streaming & Parasocial Relationships:** Analyzing audience engagement, community-building, and parasocial dynamics on platforms like Twitch.

As Director of **The SIM Lab @ SIUE**, I mentor and collaborate with students and colleagues on funded research and applied media projects. My work has appeared in journals such as *Computers in Human Behavior Reports*, *Communication Monographs*, and *Psychology of Popular Media*.

### 🚀 Open-Source Software & Projects

I create and maintain open-source tools to support teaching and research in mass communications.

  * **[Mass Communications Careers Dashboard](https://github.com/SIM-Lab-SIUE/mc-careers-dashboard)**
      * An interactive SvelteKit dashboard that maps career paths in mass communications, visualizing occupations, state-level wages, required technologies, and aligned SIUE courses.
  * **[Open WebUI Launcher for Local LLMs](https://github.com/apleith/open-webui-launcher)**
      * A beginner-friendly launcher that automates the setup of local Large Language Models (Ollama & Open WebUI) with hardware checks and safe defaults for classroom use.
  * **[mccoursepack (R Package)](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/SIM-Lab-SIUE/mccoursepack)**
      * An R package designed for my MC 451/501 courses that handles weekly content pulls, provides reproducible assignment templates (PDF-first), and includes automatic update checks.

### 📊 Research Datasets

I have collected and managed several large-scale datasets for research purposes. Access is restricted due to platform Terms of Service and IRB governance, but documentation is available.

  * **Twitch Chat Logs (2018-2019):** A collection of over 321 million messages from \~118,000 channels, involving more than 6.5 million unique viewers/chatters.
  * **VRChat Tweets (2014-2023):** A dataset of over 1.4 million original, English-language tweets mentioning "VRChat."
  * **Remote Work Tweets (2020 & 2021):** A corpus of over 1.4 million tweets from two key periods of the remote work transition (April 2020 and April 2021).
