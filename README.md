# APLEITH

## ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF MEDIA ANALYTICS AND DESIGN
## DATA SCIENTIST
## DIGITAL ANTHROPOLOGIST

I am a passionate advocate and examiner of online culture, digital games, and livestreaming. My research passions include social data and video games. I am particularly interested in examining the growing phenomenon of gameplay livestreamers and the communities that are built around them. Along with teaching, I occasionally take on private consulting contracts for both individuals and teams.
